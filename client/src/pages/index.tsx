          MetaProjection has been archived. The site previously served as an
          aggregator for Canadian federal election projections, offering
          insights into the electoral landscape at both the federal and district
          levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the deprecation of some key technologies used in the site,
          migrating to newer systems would require significant development
          effort, which I am unable to undertake at this time. As a result,
          MetaProjection now stands as a historical archive, preserving election
          projections from the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.
        </p>

          Thank you to everyone who supported and used MetaProjection over the
          yearsâ€”it was a rewarding project to work on, and I hope it served you
          well.
